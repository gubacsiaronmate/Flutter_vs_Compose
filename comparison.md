# Flutter vs. Compose Multiplatform: Pros and Cons

## Flutter

### Pros
- **Maturity**: Established framework with a larger community and more resources
- **Single Codebase**: Truly write once, run anywhere with minimal platform-specific code
- **Performance**: Uses Skia rendering engine for consistent UI and performance
- **Hot Reload**: Faster development cycles with near-instant UI updates
- **Widget Library**: Rich built-in widget collection covering most UI needs
- **Tooling**: Comprehensive dev tools including Flutter DevTools
- **Deployment Target Range**: iOS, Android, Web, Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Adoption**: Widely used in production by many companies
- **Testing Framework**: Built-in testing utilities for unit, widget, and integration tests
- **Job Market**: More job opportunities due to wider adoption

### Cons
- **Language Barrier**: Requires learning Dart, which has less general adoption
- **App Size**: Applications tend to be larger due to bundled runtime
- **Native Integration**: Sometimes requires platform channels for native features
- **Web Performance**: Web applications can be relatively heavy
- **Deep Platform Integration**: More complex to deeply integrate with platform-specific features
- **Customization**: Can be challenging to implement a highly custom UI that differs from Material/Cupertino

## Compose Multiplatform

### Pros
- **Kotlin Ecosystem**: Leverages existing Kotlin knowledge and JVM ecosystem
- **Native Performance**: Better integration with native platforms (especially Android)
- **Direct Native Access**: Easier access to platform-specific APIs
- **Flexible Architecture**: More control over application architecture
- **Kotlin Multiplatform**: Part of the larger KMP ecosystem with shared business logic
- **Modern Reactive UI**: Uses declarative, reactive programming paradigm
- **Interoperability**: Strong interop with existing Android/JVM code
- **Smaller App Size**: Generally produces more compact applications
- **Tailored Experience**: Easier to create platform-specific experiences when needed
- **Growing Community**: Rapidly growing ecosystem and Google support

### Cons
- **Immaturity**: Newer framework with fewer resources and examples
- **Platform Coverage**: Currently supports fewer platforms (Android, iOS, desktop, web in alpha)
- **Component Library**: Less comprehensive UI component library
- **Learning Curve**: Steeper learning curve for iOS developers
- **Development Speed**: May require more platform-specific adjustments
- **Community Size**: Smaller community compared to Flutter
- **Production Readiness**: Fewer large-scale production apps to reference
- **Documentation**: Less extensive documentation, especially for edge cases
- **Third-party Libraries**: Fewer multiplatform libraries available
- **Tooling**: Less mature tooling ecosystem outside Android Studio/IntelliJ

## Decision Factors to Consider

### Choose Flutter if:
- You need to target maximum platforms with minimal codebase variations
- You want a mature framework with extensive resources
- Your team can invest in learning Dart
- UI consistency across platforms is a priority
- You need to deliver a product quickly with a small team

### Choose Compose Multiplatform if:
- Your team already knows Kotlin
- Native platform integration is crucial
- You want more granular control over each platform
- You're primarily focusing on Android with iOS as secondary
- You prefer keeping business logic in Kotlin Multiplatform
- You want smaller app sizes and better native performance
